Here is a well-structured paragraph summarizing the analysis for your report:

---

The **2D Fourier transform of a separable signal** exhibits distinct characteristics in the frequency domain. Since the input signal is separable, i.e., \( x(n_1, n_2) = x_1(n_1) x_2(n_2) \), its Fourier transform also remains separable, represented as \( X(\omega_1, \omega_2) = X_1(\omega_1) X_2(\omega_2) \). This implies that the **2D spectrum is simply the product of two independent 1D spectra**. The **center bright spot** in the frequency domain highlights the main frequency components of the signal. Given that \( x_1(n_1) \) and \( x_2(n_2) \) are **exponential signals** (pure frequency components), their Fourier transform results in **Dirac delta functions**, leading to highly localized frequency responses. The **position of these frequency components is determined by \( \omega_1 \) and \( \omega_2 \)**, ensuring that the bright spots in the spectrum align with the predefined signal frequencies. Additionally, due to the separability of the signal, the spectrum remains **independent in the \( \omega_1 \) and \( \omega_2 \) directions**, resulting in a **cross-shaped structure**. This confirms that the signal contains **independent frequency components along the \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) axes**, further validating the separability property in the Fourier domain.
